# Machine learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It leverages statistical techniques to enable systems to improve their performance on a specific task as they are exposed to more data. Machine learning encompasses various approaches, including supervised learning (where models are trained on labeled data), unsupervised learning (for finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (teaching agents to make decisions in dynamic environments). It finds applications in diverse domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles, revolutionizing industries and enhancing decision-making processes.
